Python 3 has some features that are not backward compatible with Python 2, and some Python 2 libraries have not been updated to work with Python 3. I have been using Python 2, primarily because I use some of those Python 2[-only] libraries, but an increasing proportion of them are migrating to Python 3, and I anticipate shifting to Python 3 in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on the topic, I recommend a very well documented IPython Notebook, which includes numerous helpful examples and links, by [Sebastian Raschka](http://sebastianraschka.com/), [Key differences between Python 2.7.x and Python 3.x](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rasbt/python_reference/blob/master/tutorials/key_differences_between_python_2_and_3.ipynb), the [Cheat Sheet: Writing Python 2-3 compatible code](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html) by Ed Schofield ... or [googling Python 2 vs 3](https://www.google.com/q=python%202%20vs%203).\n",

We will also import the `division` module from the `future`, as I find [the use of `/` for \"true division\"](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/) - and the use of `//` for \"floor division\" - to be more aligned with my intuition.

    "* The columns in a `DataFrame` are one-dimensional arrays called [`Series`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html)\n",
    "* Elements of a `DataFrame` can be accessed using labels, positions or boolean vectors\n",
    "  * The labels for a `Series` or the rows of a `DataFrame` are accessible via their `index` attribute\n",
    "  * The labels for each column in a `DataFrame` are accessible via its `columns` attribute\n",
    "  * Individual labels can be specified using brackets or - in most cases - dotted notation\n",
    "  * Positions can be specified using the [slice operators](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html) for python sequences\n",
    "  \n",
    "Examples of these concepts will be highlighted when we first encounter them.\n",
